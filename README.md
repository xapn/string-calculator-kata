## Getting started

Fork this [repository](https://github.com/chrysocode/java8-code-kata-boilerplate) at first, then replace the artifact coordinates used by the build system. Name the code kata too.  
Make changes only in the "develop" branch.

### Tips

You may want to commit with another identifier to publish your code later. Nothing's easier:  
```
git config user.email "public@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Pseudo" # if needed
```

Take advantage of your IDE shortcuts while resolving any code kata. Download and print the [keymap](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/intellij-idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf) of IntelliJ IDEA.

### Command Line Interface as a GUI

You can invoke a standalone JAR after building it with the "standalone" Maven profile.
```
mvn package -Pstandalone # to build it
java -jar target/kata-standalone.jar # to use it
```

### Updating your fork

Update your fork as follows. It is assumed you did not commit in the "master" branch. Otherwise please send me a pull request.
```
git fetch origin master && git rebase -p --onto origin/master master develop && git branch -f master origin/master
```

## Definition of Done (DoD)

What should be a DoD for the code katas?
- The kata is done by applying [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
- The code is versioned by applying [TDDflow](https://gearsoftesting.org/tddflow.html).
- The path to the solution is discovered according to the [Transformation Priority Premise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_Priority_Premise).
- The path of successive transformations is as simple as possible.
- The code coverage is greater than 95%.
- The problem to solve is described in the kata documentation.
